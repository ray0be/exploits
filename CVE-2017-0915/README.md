# CVE-2017-0915

> Disclaimer: For educational purposes only.

This code allows you to exploit the CVE-2017-0915, by overwriting the
*authorized_keys* file for the *git* user on a vulnerable GitLab instance.
The work is based on this exploit :

 - https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/41210

Written as a Python class, it provides a way to check if the GitLab instance is
vulnerable (attacker needs an account on it), and to send the appropriate
requests to upload a malicious *authorized_keys* file containing your public
key. Then, you are able to connect via SSH as **git@target**.

Requirements :
- GitLab **v10.2.4** must be installed ;
- it must be configured to have **GitLab import enabled** (it is by default) ;
- you need an account on the GitLab (if anonymous registrations are enabled, then it's good).
